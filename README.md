# tvheadend42-avm
tvheadend4.3 packages optimized for AVM Fritz!OS 7.0x Sat>IP Service

With Update to Fritz!OS 7.0x on my Cable Box and my DVB-C Repeater using Sat>IP was broken with tvheadend. 
I opened a bug report https://tvheadend.org/issues/5365 and got a fix for tvheadend.

After exchanging my old Wetek Play w. Libreelec v9 to an Vero 4k+ OSMC based system the issue came back with the stock tvheadend package. Now I patched the latest version with the fix and it's working smooth again.

Fell free to use that on your ARM based OSMC Box, maybee it will work not only on the Vero 4k+ Device.
